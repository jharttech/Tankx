# Tankx
Project for Cert

<h2><b>Notes:</b></h2>
This game was created using the 2D framework <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE</a> for the Lua language.
The github project can be found <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love">here</a> at <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love">https://github.com/love2d/love</a></br></br>

I used vim and <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom.io</a> to write the code.  Some code was provided, I added the ability to select number of player, the ability to select difficulty levels, and the computer AI.</br></br>
I used a 3rd party library called <a href="https://github.com/Ulydev/push">Push</a>.</br></br>
Fonts used can be found <a href="https://www.dafont.com/04b-03.font">here</a></br></br>
Audio used was created using <a href="https://github.com/ttencate/jfxr">jfxr</a> in place of <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">bfxr</a> as I use linux as main OS.</br></br>

<h2><b>How To Play</b></h2>
This is a 2 player game.
Player One will use the "WASD" keys to move and the "spacebar" to shoot.

Player Two will use the arrow keys to move and the "Enter" or "Return" key to shoot.

Each tank starts with 3 HP.  Normal weapon deals 1 HP damage per hit. Heavy weapon deals 3 HP per hit. Sniper shell deals 2 HP per hit.

The first player to win 3 rounds is the games winner.

Press "esc" key anytime to exit the game.

<b>NOTE: I intend on adding more effects, shells, and HP balancing in the future, along with other options, but I am submitting this project as is to satify the requirements for the cert.

As such I am sure there are plenty of bugs to go round.</b>
